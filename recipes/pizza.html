        <p>In this section we will learn about how to make an easy homemade pizza when you don't have a lot of time. You just mix the ingredients and rest for 5 minutes until it is cooking!</p>
        <h3 class="sub1">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>

            <li>Prepare your surface with oil</li>
            <li>Shape the dough</li>

            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>

            <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
