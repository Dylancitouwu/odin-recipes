        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This air fryer French fries recipe includes a cold water-hot water soaking trick that produces super crispy French fries. Made with just four ingredients, these fries rival traditional fries but use a fraction of the oil. Serve with burgers, steak, or chicken with something to dip them in, like honey mustard, spicy ketchup, or garlic aioli.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the Potatoes</li>
            <li>Soak and Drain the Potatoes</li>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks. Place potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few inches. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with cayenne; toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. Continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately.</li>
